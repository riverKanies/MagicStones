A hearthstone clone (more or less)

Inspiration:
Hearthstone is a super addictive card-game-app that's simple enough to clone while complicated enough to stay interesting.
The game is interesting from a development standpoint because there are highly involved optimizations to consider in card design as well as AI.

Notes:
Currently, MS_prototype.html contains the most complete version, although it is not yet multiplayer. An attempt at making a conversion to multiplayer was made in the 'socket_version' project. This is a Node/socket.io based implementation (if you can call it that).
Moving forward, the plan is to convert to a Meteor app, to handle pushing state to clients and authentication, etc....
